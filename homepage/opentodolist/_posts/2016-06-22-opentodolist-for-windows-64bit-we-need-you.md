OpenTodoList on Windows has traditionally been delivered asÂ a 32bit version only. Recently, we started to investigate in an alternative build environment which will be used to create installers for future versions of the app. As a side effect, in the future we will be able to release 64bit versions of the app.

If you currently use OpenTodoList on Windows and are daring enough, you can give the [64bit version of the 2.8 release](http://rpdev.net/public/repositories/qtifw/OpenTodoList-online-windows-x86_64.exe) a try. Just download and install it - it should work as usual. (And no, besides the fact that this version of the app is 64bit, there are no new featured packed in yet ;-) ).

Have a lot of fun!
