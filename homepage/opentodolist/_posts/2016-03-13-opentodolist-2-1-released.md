We are proud to announce the release of OpenTodoList 2.1. This is the first official release of the new 2.x version line of the application. Compared to the previous versions, the new versions bring a lot of new features and enhances the data model quite a bit. Back when the application has been started, it was intended as a pure todo and task managing application. With the new releases, the app now also supports notes and images, all in one app. These items can be managed in libraries - with each one being stored as a directory on your local disk. To get the new release, please visit the [application page and select the appropriate download option](https://www.rpdev.net/wordpress/apps/opentodolist/) for your system. Bugs and feature requests can be reported in our [bug tracker](https://gitlab.com/rpdev/opentodolist/issues).
