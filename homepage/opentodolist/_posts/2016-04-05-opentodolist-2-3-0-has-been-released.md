We are proud to announce another release of OpenTodoList. Head over to the [app page](https://www.rpdev.net/wordpress/apps/opentodolist/) where you can find the individual download links. If you already installed the app, you should be able to trigger an update via the build in updater in **Help > Check for updates**.

What's new?
===========

Version 2.3.0 is a bug fix version which removes some issues introduced with the previous version 2.2.0. There was one main issue, which is that under certain circumstances deleting items from a library in the app could cause further data to be deleted. That's why we highly recommend updating to 2.3.0 as soon as possible. Additionally, some minor issues in the user interface are fixed.
