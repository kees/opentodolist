# Stay Organized

Organize todo lists, notes and images in libraries. Create e.g. a library for personal use and one for work. In addition, you can tag items inside a library, which allow you to easily break down larger collections into smaller parts.


# Sync Your Data With NextCloud, ownCloud and More

OpenTodoList allows you to synchronize your libraries with NextCloud, ownCloud and other WebDAV enabled web storage servers. In addition, as libraries are basically just a set of folders and files, you can use any third party synchronization tool of your choice.


# Your Data is Yours

We do not restrict the cloud platforms your can use to synchronize data. We have support for some platforms like NextCloud or ownCloud, which you can easily host yourself on your own or trusted hardware. In addition, you can opt to create libraries just locally e.g. on your laptop - there's no better way to prevent confidential information to leak.


# For Desktops and Mobiles

OpenTodoList is designed to run on both Desktop Operating Systems like Linux, macOS and Windows as well as mobile ones like Android.
