    <release version="3.10.3" date="2019-02-27">
        <p>
            This is a bug fix release with patches some issues with the
            Flatpak version of the app.
        </p>
    </release>
    <release version="3.10.0" date="2019-01-27">
      <p>
        This release is rather a maintenance release. It upgrades to at least
        Qt 5.11 on all supported platforms, some even to Qt 5.12. The most interesting
        part is probably that the app is now available via Flatpak. Here is the list of
        all issues that went into the release:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>#209: Update to Qt 5.11.2</li>
        <li>#211: Build ready to be used APKs in the CI</li>
        <li>#215: Build the app as Flatpak</li>
        <li>#216: AppImage is no longer working</li>
        <li>#219: Improve AppData File</li>
        <li>#220: Desktop file needs icon specified</li>
      </ul>
    </release>
    <release version="3.9.0" date="2018-11-11">
        <p>
            This relase fixes the issues #208, #202, #90, #210, #207,
            #193 and #191. The most notable change among these is the
            introduction of an item cache, which speeds up several
            aspects of the app (start-up, listing of large item
            collections and so on).
